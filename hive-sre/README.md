## Hive Upgrade Check

Review Hive Metastore Databases and Tables for upgrade or simply to evaluate potential issues.  Using [HDP Upgrade Utils](https://github.com/dstreev/hdp3_upgrade_utils) as the baseline for this effort.  The intent is to make that process much more prescriptive and consumable by Cloudera customers.  The application is 'Hive' based, so it should work against both 'HDP', 'CDH', and 'CDP' clusters.
